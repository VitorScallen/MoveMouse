# Prevent Automatic Suspension

This repository contains a simple Python script to prevent a notebook or desktop screen from entering suspension due to inactivity.

## How It Works

The `avoid_suspend.py` script uses system-level methods to send periodic commands that simulate activity, thus preventing the automatic suspension of the screen. It can be adjusted to set the interval between commands as needed.

## Prerequisites

- Python installed on the machine
- Necessary Python libraries (see `requirements.txt` for details)

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your system.
2. Install dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the `MoveMouse.py` script using Python.
4. Adjust parameters as desired (such as the time interval).

## Notes

- This script is for educational purposes only and may vary in effectiveness across different operating systems.
- Use it responsibly and understand the effects of keeping the system from suspending.
